To put Yacht behind a reverse proxy you'll need to enable websockets support as Logs, Stats, and the Dashboard use websockets.

- In Nginx Proxy Manager this is done by enabling "Websockets Support".
- For a standard nginx setup you'll need to add the following to your Yacht location block:

  ```conf
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  ```
